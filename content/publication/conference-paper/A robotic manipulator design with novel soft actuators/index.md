abstract: Soft robots are inherently compliant and adaptive, therefore they are promising candidates for interacting with humans. However robotic manipulators utilizing soft actuators are often constrained by a series of actuator performance limitations. In this work we design a novel linear soft robotic actuator with significantly improved performances over the existing products, achieving 300{\%} deformation ratio, quasi-constant output force over a wide motion range, while maintain-ing passive compliance and adaptability. Moreover, the novel actuator is less prone to friction, and could be fabricated using inject molding and 3D printing, hence having high repeata-bility at very low cost. An analytical model was developed to characterize the actuator behavior and provide a guideline for actuator design according to performance specifications. A 6 DOF soft manipulator was designed and fabricated utilizing the novel soft actuator. The manipulator arm had a serial kinematic structure with a biomimetic wrist and was driven by 12 soft actuators mounted onto the arm links. With 1.2m workspace radius and 1kg payload, the working air pressure could be as low as 1bar. Preliminary results have shown the validity of the novel soft actuator and manipulator designs, as well as the strong potential of soft robots in human-oriented applications.
