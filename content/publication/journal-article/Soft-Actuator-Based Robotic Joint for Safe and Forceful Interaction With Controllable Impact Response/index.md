abstract: Impact safety and response are critical challenges for robots working under dynamic environments and with close proximity to humans. State-of-the-art rigid robots and soft robots both have limitations and tradeoffs due to their characteristics. In this letter, we introduced a hybrid-antagonistic-pneumatic joint (HAP-joint) with soft actuators and rigid structures, achieving safe and forceful interaction. Due to the hybrid approach and the wide working range of the proprietary soft actuators, the HAP-joint could achieve controllable impact responses both predetermined by control parameters and regulated online by real-time feedback. The design, modeling, control, and experimental validation of HAP-joint are presented in detail. Based on the excellent features and performances of HAP-joint, a controller framework is formulated on impact response shaping, combining passive compliance, and online regulating. The controller could achieve both excellent tracking behavior while handling accidental impacts following a desired manner, demonstrating the vast potentials of soft robots for safe and forceful interactive tasks toward various applications.
