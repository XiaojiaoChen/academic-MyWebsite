abstract: This letter presents a novel soft robotic glove system for assistive and rehabilitative applications, offering a powerful, low-profile, and convenient solution for the growing elderly and patient population. The low-profile soft glove worn by the user weighs below 50 g, providing cable-driven flexion and extension actuations independently for all five fingers without any rigid joint or linkage, and therefore does not require joint alignment or cus- tom fitting. Novel bidirectional linear soft actuators are developed to drive each finger with enhanced payload and improved user comfort. The actuators are regulated by novel soft orifice valves developed to provide airflow control using soft material deforma- tion. The design,modeling, and fabrication procedure of the entire soft glove system is presented in detail. The system comprises en- tirely of three-dimensional (3-D) printed and commerciallyavail- able components, it is therefore repeatable by anyone with access to a consumer-grade 3-D printer. The fabricated components and glove system were evaluated in a series of validation experiments. The lightweight and compliant soft glove could achieve full-range finger motion and forces up to 40 N at the fingertip with actuation pressure as low as 60 kPa, making the system capable for most grasping and interaction tasks in healthcare, service, as well as edutainment applications.
